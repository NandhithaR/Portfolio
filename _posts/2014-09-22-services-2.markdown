  Today, technology is ubiquitous. Having grown up in a technology driven world, I have a facination for numbers and computers. I pursued my undergraduate in Computer Science in India and now pursuing a Masters in Information Systems. I love looking at different products and understanding why they are designed the way they are. I also enjoy learning new programming languages and am always working on a new project.
